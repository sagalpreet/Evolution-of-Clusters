## Graph generation
Custom algo
- threshold = 0.8
- feature distribution = uniform 0 to 1
- vulnerability distribution = uniform 0.3 to 0.8

## Community detection
Any algo would do the job

## Simulation
- threshold = 0.97
- age effect = negative

## Results
1. Communities are isolated with each other
2. But each community is EXTREMELY dense
